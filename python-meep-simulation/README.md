# Some simulation work for computational electromagnetics by Pymeep

These are some simulation works done for one friend's requirements of his major course.

They are about waveguide simulation using FDTD method.

Demand the `pymeep` library.

*To be honest, MIT meep is an open-source software, I highly recommend it!*
