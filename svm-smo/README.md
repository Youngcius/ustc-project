# SVM Classifier based on SMO Algorithm
This project realized a linear classifier based on the model of Support Vector Machine (SVM), using Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm to optimize super parameters.

The dataset `face.xlsx` is serial human face emotion data and labels. But the dataset itself is not so large.

For more result demonstration please refer to the `svm-report.pdf` file.
